## Project Design Prompt
Create only the HTML and CSS for a Magic 8-Ball web page. The 8-Ball should be a large, glossy black circle centered on the page, with a glowing blue window in the middle where answers will appear. The background should be dark and mysterious, using deep purples and blues. Use a futuristic font for the answer inside the ball, and a clean, modern font for any instructions. The design should feel sleek and mystical.

## Prompt 1
When the Magic 8-Ball is clicked, make it shake slightly before revealing an answer.

## Prompt 2
When the Magic 8-Ball is clicked, make it shake rapidly in all directions (up, down, left, right) before revealing an answer. The movement should feel random and energetic, like a real Magic 8-Ball being shaken by hand. Also, clear the answer before shaking again.
